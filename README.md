# NTier-Architectural-CSharp-
I code with NTier Architecture .Because it is flexible, controllable and absolutely good for reusability. I used five layers in my project. Models for Entites layer, data configuration for Dal layer, data options for Map, business logic for Bll layer and windows form for WinUI layer.
